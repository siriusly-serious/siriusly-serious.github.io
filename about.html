                <h3 class="">Hello! </h3><br>
                <p> Hailing from Chantilly, VA, Brandon Shen is a Chinese-American composer, saxophonist, and pianist 
                    currently studying composition and arts administration at the University of Texas at Austin under 
                    Omar Thomas. He has previously studied composition under Chris Evans Hass, and saxophone under Ed Fraedrich and Billy Wolfe.
                    Through music, he intends to explore human connection, perception, natural phenomena, 
                    and the digital age by creating musical experiences from a diverse set of mediums.
                </p>
                <!-- <p>
                    My name is Brandon Shen, a rising senior high school multi-reed performer (with a
                    focus on alto saxophone), pianist, and composer based in Loudoun County, Northern Virginia. I 
                    study saxophone under Ed Fraedrich and composition under Chris Evan Hass, and I am
                    planning to apply to a music composition program for the rapidly approaching college application
                    season.     
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have also studied saxophone with Billy Wolfe, Chien-Kwan Lin, Colin Crake, and
                    composition with David Biedenbender, and have been attended programs such as the 2022 Eastman
                    Summer Saxophone Institute and the 2023 Interlochen Summer Saxophone Intensive. I have also
                    participated in festivals such as All-Virginia band, senior regional orchestra, and all-district
                    symphonic and jazz bands, occasionally as principal alto saxophone. I am the co-founder and 
                    soprano saxophone player for the Freedom High School Saxophone Quartet, which has performed publicly 
                    at school concerts, school board meetings, and other events.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a composer, I connect to the rest of the world through music - it is the language that I am most
                    fluent in to understand others' experiences and tell my stories. I currently specialize in
                    composing for winds, although I am trying to branch out into other mediums including vocal, string,
                    and electronic music. My influences include East Asian icons like Joe Hisaishi and Takashi
                    Yoshimatsu as well as other wind band focused composers, namely John Mackey and David Maslanka.
                    Outside of classical, I love genres like drum & bass, future bass, jazz, and hip-hop, and I am
                    committed to breaking the barriers between these genres and contemporary classical music.
